# Welcome to the matmw bot repository!
###### ~god bless us all~

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This Discord bot was developed for school purposes, and its main code may contain websites and/or information pertaining to [De La Salle University](https://www.dlsu.edu.ph/). While it's main purpose is to aid students from DLSU, it is in **no way** affliated with [De La Salle University](https://www.dlsu.edu.ph/) itself.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a prototype Discord bot and is still in it's early stages. More features will be added in the future, so please don't hesitate to give useful recommendations :3

## Installation

### Cloning the files into your PC
* You will only need to download 2 files to run the Discord bot
  * ```mainfunction.py```
  * and ```.env```
* You *may* manually download the two files mentioned above and put them in a folder

* **OR** you can run the following in your command terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/rxmieowo/matmw
```
> [!TIP]
> If you have no experience with programming and don't know how to run the Python script: You can download python from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/) and search up guides on the internet on how to install it. You do not need to install other packages outside of the main Python library to use the bot, but if you somehow encounter an issue, please do let us know through the repo's [issue tab](https://github.com/rxmieowo/matmw/issues).

### Creating a ".env" file *(optional)*
##### *only do this step if the ```.env``` file does not work or if you are creating your own bot using the code from this repository* 
1. Create a ```.env``` file in the same folder that contains ```mainfunctions.py```
2. Open the ```.env``` file
3. Paste the following line into line 1:
```
DISCORD_TOKEN = 'insert your discord app token here'
```
4. Save the file

### Running the Code
* Assuming you already have done all the steps above, everything should work just fine.
* Open the ```mainfunctions.py``` file and run it.
* Go on the Discord server where the bot is, and start using any of the commands!

*dev confession: I am currently too tired and lazy to make a /help command and document all the current functions </3*
